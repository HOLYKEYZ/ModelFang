The core feature is a powerful, cross-platform global hotkey and macro engine that allows users to automate workflows.\n\nI need to build the heart of this engine: a module that can listen for keyboard and mouse events globally (i.e., when the application is not in focus), manage complex hotkey combinations, and execute user-defined actions.\n\n**Technical Specification:**\n1. Core Class: GlobalHotkeyEngine\n2. Global Event Listeners: pynput.keyboard.Listener and pynput.mouse.Listener\n3. Stateful Hotkey Detection: track modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, Cmd)\n4. Event Buffering and Processing: queue-based worker thread\n5. Macro Recording & Playback: high-precision timestamps\n6. Extensible Action System: Python functions, shell commands, macros"
